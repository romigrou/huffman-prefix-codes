Prefix-Codes
============

This repository contains both the source code for the page [The (Complete?) Guide to Huffman and Prefix Codes](https://romigrou.github.io/prefix-codes/)
and its companion example implementations.

Those example implementations start from the easiest one and each incrementally
improves upon the previous one:
  1. [Straightforward Huffman encoding and decoding](src/01-naive-huffman.cpp)
  2. [Use the canonical representation to reduce header size and decode faster](src/02-canonical-huffman.cpp)
  3. [Build the Huffman tree with linear time complexity](src/03-fast-huffman.cpp)
  4. [Compute code lengths faster by avoiding to recurse the Huffman tree](src/04-fast-lengths.cpp)

**Note**: the code is this repository was written so as to remain as legible as possible,
          it is not meant to be the most optimized implementation around
